üìÑ Speed-Based Stock Qualification Cheat Sheet
üßÆ Formula
Speed = [(Last Friday Close - Previous Friday Close) / Previous Friday Close] 
        / (Number of trading days between them) * 252 * 100



üí° Key Principles
- Fixed Anchor: The most recent Friday Close is always used as the anchor for all calculations.
- Previous Closes: Step backward one week at a time‚ÄîWeek 1 is 5 trading days ago, Week 2 is 10 days ago, and so on up to Week 10 (50 days ago).
- Normalize Time: Always divide the return by the number of trading days between the closes (i.e. weeks back √ó 5).
- Annualize: Multiply by 252 (average annual trading days).
- Express as %: Multiply the final result by 100 and shift the decimal two places right to get a percentage.

üß≠ Qualification Criteria
| Market Type | Threshold Speed (%) | 
| Bull | ‚â• 455 | 
| Bear | ‚â• 355 | 


- A stock must meet or exceed the threshold on all 10 speed checks to be considered Fully Qualified.

üîç Step-by-Step Process
- Extract Friday closing prices from your historical weekly data.
- Anchor: Use the most recent Friday Close as the fixed anchor.
- Calculate Speed for each of the previous 10 Fridays using:
- Week 1 = 5 trading days prior
- Week 2 = 10 trading days prior
- ‚Ä¶
- Week 10 = 50 trading days prior
- Apply the formula to each pair.
- Check each speed against the appropriate market threshold (Bull or Bear).
- If all 10 speeds qualify, the stock is considered Fully Qualified
